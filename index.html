<!--since the hosting service i used to host my website is false flagged
by the school's firewall, if you would really like to see it then replace
lines 13-15 with this code on a normal html file and then just run
the html file (along with the css of course) on your browser.
make sure all the files are in a folder and that the image files are
there too, all these things can easily be downloaded from the
code org website.
replace lines 13-5 (without the apostrophe)
